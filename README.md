A Password Manager in Terminal. Written in Python. Made by @arongeo

! Passmgr has lots of flaws, I wouldn't recommend using it, it is solely a project for fun, not for any actual use !

## Security
- Each username/e-mail and password is encrypted with AES-256 encryption before saving it into the SQLite Database.
- The SQLite Database is encrypted.
- Your master password is custom salted, then hashed with SHA-256 and SHA-512 to produce the AES-256 key to decrypt your other AES-256 key, which is custom generated.
